# Maintaining This Book

This page is the **update contract** for the AI agent (and human) that edits this book.
Much of Jamsession is developed conversationally with an agent, drawing on the source code,
CI, and design documents. This book is a **source of truth** for Jamsession's design and
status, so it only stays useful if it moves in lockstep with the work. When the design or the
system changes, update the docs in the *same* session — treat it as part of the change, not a
follow-up.

The rest of this page is written in the imperative, addressed to that agent.

## How the pieces relate — the Architecture section and RFDs

Jamsession keeps two kinds of design document. They are complementary views of the same
system: **RFDs describe the journey, the architecture pages describe the destination.**

| | Architecture & Design | RFD |
|---|---|---|
| Describes | the *destination* — the intended architecture as a whole | a *change* — the journey to get there |
| Answers | *how is the system meant to be built?* | *what change are we making, and why?* |
| Lifespan | living, kept current | historical once completed |

An **RFD** proposes and discusses a change. That change is often architectural — an RFD can
describe how the architecture itself should evolve, not only an implementation plan and its
steps. The **Architecture & Design** section records the destination those changes converge
on, as a single present-and-intended picture, so the current design never has to be
reconstructed by replaying every RFD.

Two practical consequences:

- **An RFD can carry architectural design, not just implementation steps.** Don't force
  architectural reasoning out of an RFD; that is a normal part of proposing a change.
- **Keep the destination current.** When an RFD lands an architectural change, reflect the
  agreed end-state in the relevant architecture page so this section stays the coherent whole.
  A reader must be able to tell built from planned (the **Build-Out Roadmap** carries the
  authoritative done/in-flight/planned status).

## When to update — trigger → page

When one of these happens, update the matching page(s) before you consider the work done:

| Trigger | Update these pages |
|---|---|
| We settle (or revise) how part of the system *should* be designed | The relevant [architecture](../design/README.md) page — record the intended destination, marking anything not yet built as planned |
| We're planning a change (including an architectural one) | Open an **RFD** (`md/rfds/<name>/`) per the [RFD process](../rfds/README.md) to describe and discuss it; track steps in its `implementation.md`. When it lands an architectural change, reflect the end-state in the [architecture](../design/README.md) page |
| An RFD's implementation step lands | Tick the step in that RFD's `implementation.md` — this is the only place per-step status lives; do **not** touch the roadmap |
| An RFD is accepted (merged, in progress) | Move it to *Accepted* in [`SUMMARY.md`](../SUMMARY.md) and [`accepted.md`](../rfds/accepted.md); flip its group to **In flight** in the [Build-Out Roadmap](../implementation/roadmap.md) |
| An RFD completes | Move it to *Completed* in [`SUMMARY.md`](../SUMMARY.md) and [`completed.md`](../rfds/completed.md); update the relevant [architecture](../design/README.md) page; flip its group to **Done** in the [Build-Out Roadmap](../implementation/roadmap.md) |
| Observable behavior changes / something ships | The relevant [architecture](../design/README.md) page (reconcile it with what now exists) |
| A new subsystem, flow, or mechanism is built | Add/update the matching [architecture](../design/README.md) page or flow diagram |
| A new module, or a change in how modules relate | The **Module map** in [architecture](../design/README.md) |
| Forward-looking work is added to the architecture (design ahead of any RFD), or a cross-group dependency or ordering changes | Add/update the group entry in the [Build-Out Roadmap](../implementation/roadmap.md) (status, dependencies, sequencing) — the only place cross-RFD ordering lives |
| A cross-cutting, load-bearing decision is made or changed | Add/update an entry in [Architecture decisions](../design/decisions.md) with a new `D<n>` code; a feature-local decision stays in its RFD and is linked from there |
| A new term worth defining | [`terminology.md`](../terminology.md) |
| Any new page | Register it in [`SUMMARY.md`](../SUMMARY.md) — a page not listed there does not render |

When a change touches more than one row, update all of them in the same change.

## Conventions

- **Architecture pages describe the intended design, and separate built from planned.** They
  may cover parts not yet implemented — that is the point of the section. But mark planned
  design clearly (a status note, or defer the detail to the Build-Out Roadmap) so nothing
  reads as built when it isn't.
- **Ground built claims in the code, use anchors not line numbers.** For anything described as existing, tie statements to
  actual modules/files and keep code-anchor references accurate. Planned design is grounded in
  the design discussion instead, and is labelled as planned.
- **Diagrams use Mermaid** in fenced ` ```mermaid ` blocks.
- **Style** (inherited from the RFD process): no promotional or dramatic language; be factual
  and brief; lead with concrete concepts, then generalize; include examples.

## Verify before you commit

Build the book locally — this is the same check CI runs on the PR, so it catches problems
before you push:

```bash
mdbook build   # or `mdbook serve` to preview and rebuild on save
```

The build surfaces the two things easiest to get wrong:

- **Orphaned pages** — a `.md` under `md/` that isn't listed in [`SUMMARY.md`](../SUMMARY.md)
  warns ("not linked to in SUMMARY.md") and won't render. Add every new page to `SUMMARY.md`
  in the same edit that creates it.
- **Stale anchors** — a broken `ANCHOR` cross-reference between docs and source reports
  "unknown anchor"; CI fails on these.

Then confirm the new/edited page appears in the sidebar and that content and intra-book links
resolve, and commit.
